Summary of debate:
Scientist: AI evidence suggests drugs poses measurable risks and needs oversight. For example, recent studies about drugs show measurable effects. Data indicates that drugs can cause harms without safeguards. Consider historical cases involving drugs that produced harm. From a public-safety view, drugs requires structured regulation. In conclusion, regulation mitigates risks associated with drugs. Consider historical cases involving drugs that produced harm.
Philosopher: Restricting youth risks undermining autonomy and philosophical inquiry. Philosophically, the value of freedom around youth must be preserved. Surveys and reports on youth highlight community concerns. Excess control of youth can stifle creativity and moral progress. In conclusion, preserving freedom around youth supports human dignity. Surveys and reports on youth highlight community concerns.
